### Hey there
I'm a Early-Career Data Scientist hoping to build a career in AI/ML research. This account is where the majority of my personal projects are developed and made available. I believe in learning by doing, this profile being a testament to that. While my focus is ML, I dip my toes in all aspects of programming because A. it's fun and B. it makes me a better programmer when I have to do real work.

#### What I'm working on
 - Figuring out what Nonlinear relations do in Deep Models (AAAI or bust)

#### What I'm trying to learn
 - Genetic Algorithms & Reinforcement Learning

#### Contact
TBD
