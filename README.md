### Hey there
I'm a college student that loves to program, and is aiming for a career in AI/ML. This account is where the majority of my personal projects are developed and made available. I believe in learning by doing, this profile being a testament to that. 

#### What I'm working on
 - Making my own LMs
 - Building a Portfolio Website/Blog

#### What I'm trying to learn
 - Jira, Terraform, all the cool professional coder stuff
 - SaaS Pegasus / Django
 - Stonks

#### Projects I'm proud of
_This usually indicates personal progress during the course of the project, rather than indicating good code._
_In fact, it usually means the opposite since it usually involves me doing something for the first time_
  - [GalaxyGen](https://github.com/Bytestorm5/GalaxyGen)
      - Pseudo-Random Galaxy Generator following the Star Wars "Hyperlane" system. Includes web editor and various tools to tune/modify the output.
      - This was born more because my (non-technical) friend group needed a tool like this, which posed an interesting challenge of making something that a non-technical user could understand and run. I don't think I achieved that strictly speaking, but it was good enough for my friends so I count that as a win.
  - [Chess Bot Thunderdome](https://github.com/Bytestorm5/ChessBot-Thunderdome) : [Website](https://thunderdome.yeruman.dev/)
      - Full Stack application for simulating chess games between a set of subpar chess engines- includes functionality for combining engines to emulate ensemble learning. Back-end built in Rust, Front-end built in React. Uses MongoDB Database to store game data.
      - This was my first serious foray into both Rust and React, while also being my first serious look into making a chess engine. Lots of firsts here, very fun project overall.
  - [Stingus Stats](https://stingus.yeruman.dev/)
      - Full stack application for generating statistics of item drop rates in Destiny 2. Back-end data collector built in C#, Front-end built with Flask and HTML templates. Uses MongoDB to track drops.
      - This is how I learned the hard way that I need to branch out from my comfort zone in Python to be decent at web dev. In any case this was a cool project and I want to eventually get back to it when I have time.
