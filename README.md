### Hey there
I'm a college student that loves to program, and is aiming for a career in AI/ML. This account is where the majority of my personal projects are developed and made available. I believe in learning by doing, this profile being a testament to that. 

#### What I'm working on
\[No public projects currently]

#### What I'm trying to learn
 - How do you gather data for language models?
 - How do I make good user interfaces?

#### Projects I'm proud of
_This usually indicates personal progress during the course of the project, rather than indicating good code_
_In fact, it usually means the opposite since it usually involves me doing something for the first time_
